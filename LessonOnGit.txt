It was not easy to setup gitHub with vsCode.

This is what ended up working:
- I had my java environment working in vsCode
- I created a folder
- using the Git bash inside vsCode:
    -  I setup my git user name and identity
    - I cloned a repository
- vsCode automatically adds the parent folder for the cloned repo to the workspace
    - So I removed the parent folder from the workspace
    - I then setup the child folder -- the cloned rep (which contains the .git folder inside) -- as the workspace folder (Add to workspace)
- I now can commit and push to upstream.
- I should be able to sync too - git.autofetch setting set to true
- I save my password for github as per: https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

Mission accomplished!
